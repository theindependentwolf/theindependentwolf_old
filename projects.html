	<!-- Birdie-G Discord Bot-->
	<h2>Birdie-G Discord Bot</h2>
	<p>This is a bot that runs on Discord (a chat application for gamers) that gets you football(soccer) related information and other fun stuff. I wrote this bot with python 3 in a hurried manner and it's a big mess. This will be re-written once I find some free time. It currently runs on the Liverpool FC unofficial discord server and has 99% uptime.</p>
